**Effective Date:** ___ day of __________, 20___

**Parties**

- **Client:** __________________ (“Client”), with its main office at ________________________________________________
- **Web Developer:** **Zain Khatri** (“Web Developer”), mailing address: __________________________________________

The Client engages the Web Developer to provide website design, development, and managed web services. The parties agree as follows.

---

## Appointment
The Client appoints the Web Developer to design, develop, and deploy the Client’s website; including agreed integrations and configurations. The Web Developer is an independent contractor; no employment, partnership, or joint venture is created.

---

## Scope of Website Development Services
Services may include; discovery and UX planning; visual design; responsive React front end; CMS configuration if applicable; content implementation; basic on-page SEO; analytics installation; forms and email routing; integrations such as reservations, online ordering, or payment links; quality assurance testing; deployment to the agreed hosting; and a concise handoff or training.

---

## Acceptance
The Web Developer will deliver a staging link for review. The Client will approve or provide one consolidated list of revisions within five business days. Acceptance occurs on written approval or upon deployment to production.

---

## Revisions and Change Orders
The project includes the revision rounds listed in **Compensation and Billing**. Additional revisions or features are out of scope; they require a written change order and are billed at **$75/hour** unless otherwise agreed.

---

## Client Responsibilities
The Client will provide timely content and assets; brand guidelines; menu or services; hours; domain or DNS access if self-managed; and platform credentials as needed. Delays in content or approvals extend the schedule. If the Client is more than fourteen days late, the Web Developer may pause work and invoice for work performed.

---

## Definitions
**Deliverables**; files, code, and assets produced for the project.  
**Confidential Information**; non-public business, technical, and customer information of either party.  
**Services**; the website design, development, and managed services under this Agreement.  
**Term**; the effective period of this Agreement.

---

## Ownership and IP
Upon full payment, the Client owns the final, project-specific Deliverables. The Web Developer retains ownership of pre-existing materials, templates, and development tools; the Client receives a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use such components as embedded in the Deliverables. Third-party libraries, fonts, stock media, and services remain under their own licenses; any fees will be disclosed and approved by the Client.

---

## Portfolio License
The Web Developer may display non-confidential work product in portfolios and marketing; the Client may opt out by written notice.

---

## Domain and DNS
- **Ownership**; the domain will be registered in the Client’s legal name. Registrar account credentials will be retained by the Client; if the Web Developer creates the domain on Client’s behalf, ownership will be transferred to a Client-controlled registrar account on request at no additional fee.  
- **Initial setup**; the initial project fee includes domain search, registration setup, DNS configuration, SSL, and launch.  
- **Renewals**; renewals are covered under the **Managed Web Plan ($50/month)** described below. If the Client does not subscribe to the Managed Web Plan, the Client is responsible for renewals and billing with the registrar.  
- **Transfers**; upon written request, the Web Developer will assist with registrar or DNS transfers and provide required auth codes within five business days.

---

## Hosting; Backups; Data
If subscribed to the **Managed Web Plan**, the site is hosted on a Web Developer–managed platform with automated backups, SSL, and security updates. If the Client self-hosts, the Client is responsible for uptime; backups; renewals; and security. For forms that collect personal data, the Client is the data controller; the Web Developer is a processor for integration only.

---

## Managed Web Plan (Optional)
**$50/month**; month-to-month; cancel anytime with 15 days’ notice.

Included:
- Domain renewal and DNS management for one standard .com/.org/.net domain  
- Managed hosting and SSL  
- Security patches; platform updates; uptime monitoring  
- Up to **30 minutes** of content updates per month (text; hours; photos; menu items)  
- Email support within **2 business days**

Not included:
- New pages; redesigns; third-party app fees; premium domains; custom infrastructure; emergency fixes outside business hours. Such work is quoted or billed at **$75/hour**. If a premium domain or higher registrar pricing is requested, the incremental cost is passed through with prior approval.

If the plan is canceled, the Web Developer will transfer the domain and provide DNS records and a site export (if applicable) within five business days.

---

## Term; Termination; Default
This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until completion unless ended earlier. Either party may terminate for material breach if uncured within ten days of written notice; or immediately upon insolvency of the other party. The Client may terminate for convenience with written notice; the Client will pay for work performed plus a termination fee equal to **15%** of the remaining unpaid project fee.
