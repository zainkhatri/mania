## Setup

### OpenAI API Integration

This application uses the OpenAI API to generate personalized journal prompts:

1. Create an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com) if you don't have one already
2. Get your API key from the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. The app uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model for the best balance of quality and cost efficiency
